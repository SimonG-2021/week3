# Week 3

## Goal

Write a class `Rational` that represents a fraction of 2 numbers. Provide a
useful interface that allows common mathematical operations.

## Remarks

- use a similar setup as last week and write unit-tests to demonstrate the functionality
- you will need the "greatest common divisor". Consider using either the STL (std::gcd)
  or implementing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm - whatever is easier
  for you.
- think carefully about your internal representation
